# sql-challenge

In this challenge, I created an ERD (entity relationship diagram) using 
https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/. Once the ERD was complete, I used it to
generate the queries to create tables in a PostgreSQL database to load a series
of CSV files with sample emloyee data. Finally, once that data had been loaded,
I queried the database for various sets of information about the employees in the sample data.

#### Follow these stops to recreate this database and run the queries in `Employees_DB_queries.sql` 

1. Clone the repository to your machine.

1. Open PGadmin and create a database named `employees_DB`.  
*Note: This project was created using PGadmin version 5.7.*

2. Open the query editor and then open `Employees_DB_queries.sql` in the editor.

3. Highlight and run all queries contained in the file to create the tables and add key contstraints.

4. Import each csv from the `data` folder into the table of the same name.  
*Make sure to import the files in the same order that the tables were created, and select the option to indicate that the files do have headers in the import window*

5. Open a new query editor and then open the `Employees_DB_queries.sql` file.

6. Highlight and run each query in the `Employees_DB_queries.sql` file to see the employee information generated by each query.
